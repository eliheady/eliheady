## Hello

I do software development and ops work and love building and running things.

I have worked in a variety of engineering and operations roles: Syseng on
a supercomputer, Python SWE and DevSecOps consulting in financial services,
Go and Python dev on high volume serverless AWS, DevOps IaC development
in fintech, Linux sysadmin in higher ed and robotics.

- 🔭 I’m working on enterprise systems automation.
- 🌱 I’m learning Japanese. はじめまして、イーライです。
- 🍶 I make wheel-thrown pottery.
- ⚡ Fun fact: A freak piñata injury led to extreme photophobia and effective
    blindness in one of my eyes. That is why I wear goofy glasses.
